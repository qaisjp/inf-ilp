\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Coinz is an Android app. Prior to the release of Android Studio I had attempted Android development. It was an \textit{interesting} experience and everything was running excruciatingly slow on my old machine. So, after discovering that iOS development (with Swift) had a ``better'' ecosystem, I gave up on Android and have not touched the SDK since.

Since then I've shifted my focus towards developing webapps and I'd like to take this opportunity to delve back into app development, in particular, app development for Android.

One of the primary development goals I hope to achieve from this project is to gain some more practical experience with developing for systems with limited resources (i.e mobile phones).

Eventually, I hope that all the insight gained from this project will lead me into a hobby of professional app development.

\section{Bonus features}
\label{sec:bonus}
\subsection{Design}
Explain a step-by-step recipe for fabrication here. How long did you etch and why? What is an Ohmic contact?
\subsection{Experimental set-up}
Explain the experimental set-up here. Use a schematic picture (make it yourself in photoshop, paint, ...) to show how the components are connected. Briefly explain how a lock-in amplifier works.

Show a graph of the longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) and Hall resistivity ($\rho_{xy}$) versus magnetic field, extracted from the raw data shown in figure \ref{fig:data}. You will have the link to the data in your absalon messages, if not e-mail Guen (guen@nbi.dk). Explain how you calculated these values, and refer to the theory.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	% \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{raw_data.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:data}Raw (unprocessed) data. Replace this figure with the one you've made, that shows the resistivity.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Classical regime}
Calculate the sheet electron density $n_{s}$ and electron mobility $\mu$ from the data in the low-field regime, and refer to the theory in section \ref{sec:bonus}. Explain how you retrieved the values from the data (did you use a linear fit?).
Round values off to 1 or 2 significant digits: 8.1643 ~= 8.2. Also, 5e-6 is easier to read than 0.000005.

!OBS: This part is optional (only if you have time left).
Calculate the uncertainty as follows: \newline $u(f(x, y, z)) = \sqrt{(\frac{\delta f}{\delta{x}} u(x))^{2} + (\frac{\delta f}{\delta{y}} u(y))^{2} + (\frac{\delta f}{\delta{z}} u(z))^{2}}$, where $f$ is the calculated value ($n_{s}$ or $\mu$), $x, y, z$ are the variables taken from the measurement and $u(x)$ is the uncertainty in x (and so on).

\section{Language of choice}
\label{sec:language}

% You should document your rationale for choosing Java or Kotlin as the language.
% The app is being developed in the scenario where you'll hand it off to a team of developers who'll maintain and develop it further.
% Your rationale should be based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two languages, rather than your taste in programming languages.

\subsection{Why \emph{Java}?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Java is a C-style programming language and doesn't stray too far from the norm, so a developer who knows C, C++ or JavaScript will easily be able to pick up the project and understand the code.
	\item Java has been in use for many years. It is clearly stable and well-supported (by Oracle, Google, and the rest of the internet community.)
	\item A lot of examples are available in Java.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Why \emph{Kotlin}?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Kotlin has a lot of shorthands that facilitates rapid prototyping. And this is \emph{not} at the expense of readability!\cite{whykotlin}
	\item Kotlin solves a lot of issues that developers have had with Java... spend less time worrying about at \emph{NullPointerException}---it's clear where and when such an exception can be thrown.
	\item Documentation is widely available. Communities exist online\cite{kotlincommunity} to ask questions. Officially supported by Google for Android development.
	\item Anko \emph{just makes a lot of things easier}. Developers should spend less time reinventing the wheel, and just getting things done.
	\item Ultimately, keeping on top of technology (and not sticking with the same-old legacy code) is important. Developers should always be up to date and shouldn't get too comfortable with one language. A developer learning Kotlin for the first time will gain an educational benefit from the experience.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What I've chosen}
I've chosen \emph{Kotlin} because I feel that keeping up to date and having code being free of cruft (i.e, easy to understand and visualise) is of the utmost importance for developers.

Many developers spend a lot of time reinventing the wheel and writing the same chunks of code (in a way that cannot be made DRY), and Kotlin either fixes the underlying problem, introduces shorthands, or has a library available to resolve these situations.

Kotlin is interopable with Java and so a developer can still introduce some code from their own library. All Java code can be "converted" to Kotlin, and this is an educational tool to see how certain chunks of code can be implemented (albeit not idiomatically).

\section{Some LaTeX tips}
\label{sec:latex}
\subsection{How to Include Figures}

First you have to upload the image file (JPEG, PNG or PDF) from your computer to writeLaTeX using the upload link the project menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in your document. Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a number and a caption to your figure. See the code for Figure \ref{fig:frog} in this section for an example.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	% \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{frog.jpg}
	\caption{\label{fig:frog}This frog was uploaded to writeLaTeX via the project menu.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to Make Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|r}
		Item    & Quantity \\\hline
		Widgets & 42       \\
		Gadgets & 13
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection{How to Write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let

\begin{equation}
	S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
	= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
	\label{eq:sn}
\end{equation}

denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

The equation \ref{eq:sn} is very nice.

\subsection{How to Make Sections and Subsections}

Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.

\subsection{How to Make Lists}

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Like this,
	\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
	\item Like this,
	\item and like this.
\end{itemize}
\dots or with words and descriptions \dots
\begin{description}
	\item[Word] Definition
	\item[Concept] Explanation
	\item[Idea] Text
\end{description}

We hope you find write\LaTeX\ useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback using the help menu above.
