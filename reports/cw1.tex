\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
      
Coinz is an Android app. Prior to the release of Android Studio I had attempted Android development. It was an \textit{interesting} experience and everything was running excruciatingly slow on my old machine. So, after discovering that iOS development (with Swift) had a ``better'' ecosystem, I gave up on Android and have not touched the SDK since.

Since then I've shifted my focus towards developing webapps and I'd like to take this opportunity to delve back into app development, in particular, app development for Android.

One of the primary development goals I hope to achieve from this project is to gain some more practical experience with developing for systems with limited resources (i.e mobile phones).

Eventually, I hope that all the insight gained from this project will lead me into a hobby of professional app development.

\section{Bonus features}
\label{sec:bonus}
\subsection{Design}
Explain a step-by-step recipe for fabrication here. How long did you etch and why? What is an Ohmic contact?
\subsection{Experimental set-up}
Explain the experimental set-up here. Use a schematic picture (make it yourself in photoshop, paint, ...) to show how the components are connected. Briefly explain how a lock-in amplifier works.

Show a graph of the longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) and Hall resistivity ($\rho_{xy}$) versus magnetic field, extracted from the raw data shown in figure \ref{fig:data}. You will have the link to the data in your absalon messages, if not e-mail Guen (guen@nbi.dk). Explain how you calculated these values, and refer to the theory.
      
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	% \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{raw_data.png}
	\caption{\label{fig:data}Raw (unprocessed) data. Replace this figure with the one you've made, that shows the resistivity.}
\end{figure}
      
\subsection{Classical regime}
Calculate the sheet electron density $n_{s}$ and electron mobility $\mu$ from the data in the low-field regime, and refer to the theory in section \ref{sec:bonus}. Explain how you retrieved the values from the data (did you use a linear fit?).
Round values off to 1 or 2 significant digits: 8.1643 ~= 8.2. Also, 5e-6 is easier to read than 0.000005.
      
!OBS: This part is optional (only if you have time left).
Calculate the uncertainty as follows: \newline $u(f(x, y, z)) = \sqrt{(\frac{\delta f}{\delta{x}} u(x))^{2} + (\frac{\delta f}{\delta{y}} u(y))^{2} + (\frac{\delta f}{\delta{z}} u(z))^{2}}$, where $f$ is the calculated value ($n_{s}$ or $\mu$), $x, y, z$ are the variables taken from the measurement and $u(x)$ is the uncertainty in x (and so on).

\section{Language of choice}
\label{sec:language}
      
\subsection{Why Java?}
Here, explain the concept of a 2-DEG in GaAs/AlGaAs. What is a 2-DEG and why does it arise?

\subsection{Why Kotlin?}
Explain the classical Hall effect in your own words. What do I measure at $B=0$? And what happens if $B>0$? Which effect gives rise to the voltage drop in the vertical direction?

\subsection{What I've chosen}
Explain the IQHE in your own words. What does the density of states look like in a 2-DEG when $B=0$? What are Landau levels and how do they arise? What are edge states? What does the electron transport look like when you change the magnetic field? What do you expect to measure?

\section{Some LaTeX tips}
\label{sec:latex}
\subsection{How to Include Figures}
      
First you have to upload the image file (JPEG, PNG or PDF) from your computer to writeLaTeX using the upload link the project menu. Then use the includegraphics command to include it in your document. Use the figure environment and the caption command to add a number and a caption to your figure. See the code for Figure \ref{fig:frog} in this section for an example.
      
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	% \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{frog.jpg}
	\caption{\label{fig:frog}This frog was uploaded to writeLaTeX via the project menu.}
\end{figure}
      
\subsection{How to Make Tables}
      
Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example.
      
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l|r}
		Item    & Quantity \\\hline
		Widgets & 42       \\
		Gadgets & 13       
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}
      
\subsection{How to Write Mathematics}
      
\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
      
\begin{equation}
	S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
	= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i
	\label{eq:sn}
\end{equation}
      
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
      
The equation \ref{eq:sn} is very nice.
      
\subsection{How to Make Sections and Subsections}
      
Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. \LaTeX{} handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.
      
\subsection{How to Make Lists}
      
You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots
      
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Like this,
	\item and like this.
\end{enumerate}
\dots or bullet points \dots
\begin{itemize}
	\item Like this,
	\item and like this.
\end{itemize}
\dots or with words and descriptions \dots
\begin{description}
	\item[Word] Definition
	\item[Concept] Explanation
	\item[Idea] Text
\end{description}
      
We hope you find write\LaTeX\ useful, and please let us know if you have any feedback using the help menu above.
