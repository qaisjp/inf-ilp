Dear ILP student,

Please find your feedback for the 1st coursework below (verbatim). Your grade for this coursework (prior to any potential late penalties; which we do not account for here) is the sum of the individual marks below +5 for sharing your repository, rounded up (ignore any sum the marker might have added).


> Training sessions are interesting, but I there is no good motivation for why the user might be interested in completing past maps if the results have no impact on their account. Custom maps on the other hand sound really interesting, and could piggyback on the functionality you build for loading older maps. 'Friends' is solid and well motivated. The rest of the features are welcome, if a bit generic. You could have been more specific on the easter eggs part. But there is enough here to make a good set. [7/8]
>
> You bring up most important points on Java and Kotlin, and I was happy to see a dedicated section for each. A fair comparison overall. I would have liked to see you addressing the fact that other people will have to take over your project. The information is there but not the perspective. [7/8]
>
> Explicit testing from week 3. I feel obliged to give full marks. The rest is well written as well though, and you seem to cover all angles including unit testing and documentation, even leaving a week for submitting. [4/4]


All the best,
Pavlos.
